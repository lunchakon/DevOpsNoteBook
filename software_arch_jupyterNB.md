Below is an explanation of system architecture using a Jupyter notebook to visualize the components involved in a common architecture—such as client-server, microservices, or cloud-based distributed systems. This example will simulate a typical architecture for a web service involving clients, APIs, databases, and caching systems (e.g., Redis).

# Steps:
#Use Python diagrams to visualize system components.
#Simulate a client-server interaction with HTTP requests.
#Demonstrate caching using Redis.
#Explain how the components interact logically in the architecture.

# 1. Install Required Packages
In a Jupyter notebook, the following packages are needed to visualize the architecture and simulate HTTP + Redis requests.
```pip install diagrams requests redis```


# 2. Visualize the System Architecture with diagrams
Create a diagram that shows the key components of the system: Client, Web API, Database, Redis cache, and External Services.

from diagrams import Diagram
from diagrams.aws.compute import EC2
from diagrams.onprem.client import User
from diagrams.onprem.cache import Redis
from diagrams.onprem.database import PostgreSQL
from diagrams.onprem.network import Nginx

# Create a system architecture diagram
```
with Diagram("System Architecture", show=True):
    user = User("Client")
    web_server = Nginx("Web Server/API")
    cache = Redis("Redis Cache")
    db = PostgreSQL("Database")

    # Define relationships between components
    user >> web_server >> cache
    cache >> db
```

This will generate a diagram of a web-based system architecture where:

Client sends requests to a web server (API).
The web server first checks the Redis cache.
If the data is not in the cache, the server retrieves it from the database.

# 3. Simulate a Client Request to the Server
We can use Python's requests library to simulate a client-server interaction.

Create a mock API endpoint using httpbin.org for testing HTTP requests:
```import requests

def simulate_client_request():
    url = "https://httpbin.org/get"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Client received data:", response.json())
    else:
        print("Failed to fetch data from the server")

simulate_client_request()```

4. Simulate Caching with Redis
```import redis

# Connect to Redis (assuming it's running on localhost)
cache = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, decode_responses=True)

# Store data in Redis cache
cache.set("user:1001", "John Doe")
print("Cached data:", cache.get("user:1001"))

# Simulate cache hit or miss
def get_user_data(user_id):
    user = cache.get(f"user:{user_id}")
    if user:
        print(f"Cache hit: {user}")
    else:
        print("Cache miss: Fetching from the database...")

get_user_data(1001)  # Should print a cache hit
get_user_data(1002)  # Should print a cache miss```

# 5. Explanation of the Architecture
Client (User): Sends requests to the server, typically through a web or mobile app.
Web Server (API): Processes the requests and sends responses back to the client.
Redis Cache: Caches frequently requested data to reduce the load on the database.
Database (PostgreSQL): Stores persistent data, such as user profiles or transactions.
Nginx: Acts as a reverse proxy, balancing traffic between different web services.



# 6. Run it in a Jupyter Notebook
Copy the above code blocks into a Jupyter notebook, and run the cells sequentially. You’ll see:

A diagram showing the architecture.
A client request simulation with HTTP.
A Redis cache demonstration with cache hit/miss logic.
